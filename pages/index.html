			With the arrival of the concept of "apps", no matter if it is Apple, Google or Microsoft, developers have gotten a lot of framework and "rules & regulations" which actually make it a lot easier to write an application. Unfortunately there is nothing like such for desktop applications, here developers still need to see how their application can be downloaded and find solutions to install & update.

			Dapplo is based on the experience build while developing and modernizing Greenshot. Having a bit of experience writing apps, it quickly shows how many services are missing, and how much infrastructure needs to be maintained by one self.
			
			The idea behind Dapplo is to provide Open-Source building blocks, with utilities and service which should support building .NET applications quicker. There even is a plan to write a .NET application which can download and update small "dapplo" based applications, with this it is possible to have a single .NET process hosting multiple tools.
			
			Please look at the building blocks and documentation, and while it is Open Source it would be nice if you participate with pull requests.
