This repository contains a Microsoft Visual Studio solution for C# .NET with one dapplo building block project and a test case project which is used for testing the code and also serves as example code. The building block was created so applications can easily add "add-ons".

While writing Greenshot 2.x it was clear there are a lot of functions needed for reading Add-ons.
