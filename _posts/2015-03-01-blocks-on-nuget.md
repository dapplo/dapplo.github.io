As Greenshot needed updates to the way it was connecting to Jira and Confluence, I wrote a new block: [Dapplo.Jira](http://www.dapplo.net/blocks/Dapplo.Jira/)
And thanks to the great Continuous Integration system [AppVeyor](http://www.appveyor.com/), it was very easy to automate deployment to NuGet.
