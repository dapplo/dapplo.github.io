As Greenshot needed updates to the way it was connecting to Jira and Confluence, I wrote a new block: [Dapplo.JsonRest]({% post_url 2015-03-01-blocks-on-nuget %})
And thanks to the great Continuous Integration system [AppVeyor](http://www.appveyor.com/), it was very easy to automate deployment to NuGet.
