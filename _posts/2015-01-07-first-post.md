After having finished Greenshot 1.2 I finally I managed to find some time to setup my blog, using github pages and Jekyll!

With having the fist dapplo "block" repository in a state where it starts to be useful, I want to present this here.

The [Dapplo.Config](https://github.com/{{site.github_username}}/Dapplo.Config) block will make it easier to have a configuration in your application. There still are many things to do, but maybe you can have a look at it.
